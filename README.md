| Version       | Date          | Wurm Version  | Comment(s)   |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|:----------   |
| 1             | July 15, 2017 | 1.4.0.1       |- Made a GitHub because rogue Wurm sites always disappear to lack of maintenance<br/>- 1.4.0.1 client cracked with a Steam Emulator|
| 2             | July 16, 2017 | 1.4.0.1       |- Headless Linux server is a success, albeit with SteamAPI|
| 3             | July 17, 2017 | 1.4.0.1       |- SteamAPI work-around applied and tested on Linux. It's quick and cheap (could be done better at the expense of time) but allows non-Steam users to join, in addition to listing the server on the browser and letting normal Steam users join<br/>- Next up: will a seedbox be enough to long-term host a server?|
